## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the web server
python3 server.py 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. The sequencer and 3D visuals work standalone.

### With AI Audio Generation

Run [ACE-Step 1.5](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step) on port 8001:

```bash
cd /path/to/ACE-Step-1.5
uv run acestep-api --init-llm --lm-model-path acestep-5Hz-lm-4B
```

The proxy server forwards `/ace-api/*` automatically:

```bash
ACE_STEP_URL=http://localhost:8001 python3 server.py 8080
```

### With LLM Tag Generation

Serve a local LLM via vLLM on port 8002 for dynamic tag cascade:

```bash
bash start_llm.sh
```

This serves an 8B parameter model (~17-20 GB VRAM). Without it, fallback hardcoded tags are shown.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key for texture generation | — |
| `ACE_STEP_URL` | ACE-Step server URL | `http://localhost:8001` |
| `LLM_URL` | vLLM server URL for tag generation | `http://localhost:8002` |

## LoRA Training Guide

The LoRA Studio lets you fine-tune ACE-Step's DiT decoder on your own audio to create custom sound adapters. Here's the complete workflow.

### How LoRA Works

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) injects small trainable matrices into the model's attention layers (q/k/v/o projections) while keeping the base model frozen. This means:

- **Tiny adapter files** (~5-20 MB vs 6+ GB base model)
- **Fast training** (minutes to hours, not days)
- **No base model modification** — load/unload adapters freely
- **Stackable influence** — scale from 0% to 100% effect

### Preparing Your Dataset

**Supported formats:** `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.opus`

**Directory structure — just put audio files in a folder:**

```
my_dataset/
├── track1.wav
├── track2.mp3
├── ambient_pad.flac
├── bassline_loop.ogg
└── ...
```

**Optional enhancements:**

- **Companion lyrics:** Place a `.txt` file with the same name next to an audio file to provide lyrics
  ```
  my_dataset/
  ├── vocal_track.wav
  ├── vocal_track.txt    ← lyrics for vocal_track.wav
  ```
- **CSV metadata:** Place a CSV file in the directory with columns for `filename`, `bpm`, `keyscale`, `caption` to pre-fill metadata (avoids LLM auto-labeling for those fields)

**Best practices:**
- 5-50 audio files is a good range for LoRA training
- Consistent style/genre across files produces more coherent adapters
- Files can be any length (up to 240 seconds; longer files are truncated)
- Stereo or mono both work (mono is auto-duplicated to stereo)
- 48kHz is native sample rate (others are resampled automatically)

### Step 1: Preprocessing

Click **PREPROCESS** in the LoRA Studio after entering your audio directory path. This runs three stages:

**1a. Scan** — Walks the directory tree, discovers audio files, loads companion lyrics/CSV metadata, calculates durations.

**1b. Auto-Label** — For each audio file, the system:
1. Encodes the audio into semantic tokens via the DiT model's audio encoder
2. Sends tokens to the 5Hz LLM which generates:
   - **Caption** — Natural language description ("dark rolling psytrance bassline with squelchy 303 acid")
   - **Genre tags** — Style classifications
   - **BPM** — Estimated beats per minute
   - **Key/Scale** — Detected musical key
   - **Time signature** — 4/4, 3/4, etc.
   - **Language** — Vocal language (or "instrumental")
   - **Lyrics** — Transcribed lyrics (if vocal)

   CSV-provided metadata is preserved and not overwritten.

**1c. Tensor Conversion** — For each labeled sample:
1. Load audio at 48kHz stereo
2. Encode through VAE → `target_latents` (compressed audio representation)
3. Tokenize caption + metadata → `text_hidden_states` (text condition)
4. Tokenize lyrics → `lyric_hidden_states` (lyric condition)
5. Fuse conditions through the model encoder → `encoder_hidden_states`
6. Build context latents from silence template → `context_latents`
7. Save all tensors to a `.pt` file (~1-10 MB per sample)

The tensor directory path auto-fills after preprocessing completes.

**Why preprocess?** All the expensive VAE/text encoding is done once upfront. Training then loads pre-computed tensors directly — no VAE or text encoder needed during training, making each epoch very fast.

### Step 2: Training

Set your parameters and click **START TRAINING**:

| Parameter | Range | Default | Description |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Rank** | 1-64 | 8 | LoRA rank — higher = more capacity but more VRAM |
| **Alpha** | 1-128 | 16 | Scaling factor — `alpha/rank` controls LoRA strength |
| **Epochs** | 1-500 | 100 | Training iterations over the full dataset |
| **LR** | 1e-6 to 1e-2 | 1e-4 | Learning rate (log scale slider) |

**What happens during training:**

1. LoRA matrices are injected into the DiT decoder's attention layers (q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, o_proj)
2. All base model parameters are frozen — only LoRA matrices train
3. Each step:
   - Load pre-computed tensors (target audio latents + conditions)
   - Sample random noise and a discrete timestep from the turbo schedule
   - Interpolate between noise and audio: `x_t = t * noise + (1-t) * audio`
   - Forward through decoder to predict the flow (velocity from audio to noise)
   - Compute MSE loss between predicted and actual flow
   - Update only LoRA parameters via AdamW optimizer
4. Checkpoints saved every N epochs (default 10) with full PEFT adapter format

**Training tips:**
- Start with defaults (rank=8, alpha=16, lr=1e-4, 100 epochs)
- Watch the loss curve — it should decrease and plateau
- Higher rank (16-32) for complex style changes, lower (4-8) for subtle tweaks
- Reduce LR (1e-5) if loss is unstable, increase (5e-4) if learning is too slow
- Training locks the inference executor — generation is paused during training

**Output structure:**
```
lora_output/
└── lora_20250208_143022/
    ├── adapter/
    │   ├── adapter_config.json
    │   └── adapter_model.safetensors
    ├── lora_weights.pt
    └── checkpoints/
        ├── epoch_10/
        ├── epoch_20/
        └── ...
```

### Step 3: Using Your LoRA

1. Click **REFRESH** in the adapter browser to see your trained adapters
2. Click an adapter to fill the path field
3. Click **LOAD** — the status dot turns green
4. Click **ON** to activate — dot turns cyan
5. Adjust **SCALE** slider (0.0 = base model, 1.0 = full LoRA effect)
6. Generate audio as normal — your LoRA influences the output style

**Controls:**
- **ON/OFF** — Toggle LoRA without unloading (instant, uses PEFT enable/disable)
- **SCALE** — Blend between base model and LoRA (useful for subtle influence)
- **UNLOAD** — Fully restore the base model (frees LoRA memory)

You can load different adapters for different generation tasks. The base model is always preserved — unloading restores it exactly.

## VRAM Requirements

| Component | VRAM | Required? | Notes |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------|
| ACE-Step 1.5 (DiT + VAE + 5Hz LM) | ~27 GB | Yes (for AI audio) | Core music generation |
| Tag LLM (default: Qwen3-8B via vLLM) | ~17-20 GB | No | Fallback hardcoded tags work without it |
| LoRA Training | ~5-15 GB additional | No | Only during active training |
| **Full stack** | **~50-60 GB** | | All services + training |

### Configuration Tiers

| Setup | VRAM Needed | What Works |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Sequencer only** (no AI) | 0 GB | Step sequencer, sound engine, 3D visuals — no GPU needed |
| **ACE-Step only** | ~27 GB | AI audio generation + sequencer (no dynamic tags) |
| **ACE-Step + small LLM** | ~30-35 GB | Full features with a lighter tag model (see below) |
| **ACE-Step + 8B LLM** | ~45-50 GB | Full features with best tag quality |
| **Everything + LoRA training** | ~55-65 GB | All features including fine-tuning |

### Using a Smaller Tag LLM

The default 8B model gives the best tag quality but isn't required. You can swap it for a smaller model by editing `start_llm.sh`:

```bash
# 3B model (~6-8 GB VRAM) — good quality, much lighter
MODEL="Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct"

# 1.5B model (~3-4 GB VRAM) — basic quality, minimal VRAM
MODEL="Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct"

# 0.5B model (~1-2 GB VRAM) — lowest quality, near-zero overhead
MODEL="Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct"
```

Or skip the tag LLM entirely — the app falls back to hardcoded genre tags when no LLM is available.
